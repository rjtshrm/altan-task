### ALTAN TASKS

##### TASK 2:

Tested on  python 3.7 (can work with python 3.5 and above)
Merge Interval which overlaps

###### How to run:```python3 task2.py```

###### Time Complexity: O(n);  n number of intervals

###### Robustness Check: 
- Verification of Algorithm
- Test cases passed

###### Memory Consumption:
- Stack is used.
- Memory depends on type of interval (int, float, double)
- Automatic memory free when program finishes
